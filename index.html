    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is a small world of mine. I wish to express my thoughts in pure HTML.</p>

    <h2>#1 The Watch</h2>
    <p>I have choosen Casio F-94W as my watch, the only watch for all occasions. The reason why is that it is cheap, reliable and available yet bold, historical, modern, controversy and (imo) prestigious all at once. In short, it represent me. </p>

    <h2>#2 The one truly matter</h2>
    <p>I am experimenting with a concept called "Tree Shaking" in keeping things in my life, a concept I borrowed from Firebase where only required code from library being imported to your project instead of the whole library. By doing this, it makes your project lighter and faster. Same goes to life, I believe that one should conduct life minialistly where only things you truly required you should keep or buy. This make your life easier to manage and give you sense of control. I like my life clean not bloated like typical android smartphones with so many unnessary apps that does almost nothing substantial. So, my extreme plan is to make an inventory of everything things i own. By doing book keeping, somehow I guess it will make me feel much in control of my life. But not sure where I should host the inventory list. I am thinking online inventory should be great but I wish to remain incognito. Let see how this project goes. </p>

    <h2>#3 The School I went</h2>
    <p>I were sent to a boarding school in Perlis. I had a rough and soft experience back in the school. Did stupid things, lived like an animal and being barbaric. There I started to understand what is Rule of Jungle, where it doesnt matter what is right or wrong, what does matter is what is strong and what is weak. Anything goes back then. You got to survive.

    <h2>#6 The Unexplained</h2>
    <p>On one casual evening in January 2024, after some weekly updates, I took some times to talk other than works related topic with my boss, I could not remember exactly how this particular topic slipped into the discussion we are having. But the topic slipped in anyway. It was about religious routine in Islamic Tradition called daily prayers. For those who didnt know daily prayers is a prayers required to be performed by every muslim five times a day at specific times in which I didnt performed for about 11 years or more. I do not perfomed the daily prayers for one particular reason; I just dont feel like I want to. Yet somehow the short conversations I had that evening with my boss had changed my stand. I started to pray even thought deeply somehow I feel like I dont want to. I promised to try for 40 days. So, I am trying it. Lets see in the next 40 days how I am going to feel about this. Does it going to change how I feel towards the practice or nothing will change?  </p>
